(ex Protecteddownload)
===================================

History:

1 (2013) published as CMSimple_XH add-on under the name 
         Protecteddownload by svasti http://svasti.de
1.1 errormessage added, code by cmb
1.2 small change in download package
1.3 filenames can contain spaces (e.g. MS-Word filenames)
1.4 added .htaccess to download
1.5 All chars and Windows-1252 encoding in filenames enabled

October 2015
- Protecteddownload was transformed in to a plugin by 
  Holger Irmler http://cmsimple.holgerirmler.de
- He added the possibility to send automatically a notification email
  to an administrator when a download was started.
- He also added date control of the download.

1.6 - January 2016 by svasti again
- Plugin renamed to Downloadcontrol_XH as already a plugin with
  the name protected_Download_XH (by Emanuel Marinello, http://so-leicht.ch) existed.
- Editable download counter added
- Plugin call for number of downloads of a file added
- Password controlled download possibility added
- Log added, recording file, time and downloader's name or IP address, 
  compatible with dlcounter_XH log
- Log analysis added
- Most recent log entries are displayd in plugin main
- Help files added
- Graph displaying the downloads of the last 30 days added
- Download link can be
    - big button
    - small button
    - inline link
    - button asking for password
    - button asking for downloader's name + location
    - list of downloadable files of a folder 
      (when a folder name is 1st argument of plugin call),
      this list is displayed as inline links or small buttons.
- Easy Update: Log and config files are not part of plugin package. 
  They are generated on install if missing.
  In case an old config file is found, its content is read 
  and used for the generation of the new config file.
- If files from subfolders of the protected folder are called, 
  the subfolder will not be displayed any more in the link 
  (was displayed in the older add-on version).

1.6.1 - Feb 2016
- Text input limited to 50 chars to avoid SPAM (suggestion by Ludwig)
- Input field cleared (via javascript) after submit (suggestion by Ludwig)
- New download button option where login via memberpages/register_XH is asked 
  before downloading

1.7 - July 2016
- Checks if .htaccess is present in Downloadcontrol base folder or one of its subfolders. Checks also
  if .htacces is present in log folder.
- A short description of the plugin call is accessable via button click on backend plugin main page
- Download offers also in table form as file lists, with selectable display
  of date of last file change and number of downloads (suggested by Tata)
- File lists in table layout not only from foldernames but also from comma separated file list
- File list in table layout and single file downloads get separate config settings
- File list can have same access restrictions (log-in, password, name/location of downloader, date control)
  as single file download links
- log etc now in userfiles/plugin/downloadcontrol,
  during updating the old log files are checked and, if the new ones are empty, copied to the new location
- edit view of counter file now opens together with log analysis, no separate log anaylsis button any more
- Short cuts for plugin calls with checkbox interface in the backend
- Sync possibility with Dlcounter_XH log
- Writing to log now with flock
- Tables responsive, fields collapse below 500px width viewport to inline blocks.
- Bug-fix (thanx to mhz's testing) subfolders didn't work for short cut feature. Now added warning if file name
  occurs more than once.
- Added simple color selector for button and tables including color choice for an alternative button
- Added defaultconfig.php so that no erromessages occur on installing the plugin
